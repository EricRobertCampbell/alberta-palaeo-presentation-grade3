# Palaeontology Presentation
## Alberta Grade 3

This is a presentation and set of activities for use with a Grade 3 class. It covers most of the palaeontology portion of the Grade 3 Science (Alberta) curriculum.

The plan for the presentation & activities is contained in the Presentation Proposal. Otherwise, which activities you use and the order in which you do them will depend on the previous knowledge of the students and the time available, as well as the other myriad factors that come from the indiviual class to which you are presenting.

To the best of my knowledge, I have used mostly images and resources which are free to use (generally Creative Commons). For the rest, I believe them to be covered under Fair Dealing, which covers the use of copyrighted images for educational resources. If you are the copyright holder to one of these images and wish for them to be removed, please let me know and I will do so as quickly as possible.

The actual presentation and other materials are covered by the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Deed)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licence.

If you use any of this material (or even if you don't!) and have comments or suggestions, I would love to hear them! I would love if using this material made the teaching of palaeontology in Alberta even slightly easier for someone.
